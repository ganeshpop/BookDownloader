About the Author</h2><p class="docText"><span class="docEmphStrong">James Elliott</span> is a senior software engineer at Berbee, with over 15 years of professional experience as a systems developer. A decade before that career, he cultivated his involvement and fascination with computers, and started designing with objects well before his work environments made it convenient. He has a passion for building high-quality tools and frameworks to simplify the tasks of other developers, and loves how using Java effectively can help in that effort. After a globe-trotting childhood, Jim earned his bachelor's degree in computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic in upstate New York and his master's at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with some interesting stints at Bell Laboratories (in Murray Hill, birthplace of C and Unix). Although he succumbed to the allure of the real world shortly after completing his Ph.D. qualifying exams, he was happy to find interesting work in Madison, where he lives with his partner Joe Buberger and two challenging cats.</p></div></div></body>
